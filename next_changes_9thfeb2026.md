- Make header on home page consitently everywhere. Need this on stock page, and watchlist, and market thing page

- The data on the compare stocks grid is not properly aligned in a grid. it's not showing up in the proper line, and grid lines are not visible

- in watchlist we should show symbols cof each stock, also in compare grid on stock page and watchlist, we should show symbol on top of all. In order to show a better comparison maybe we can show some more icons and graphics as well too of the data.
