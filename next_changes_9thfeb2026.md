- ✔️ Make header on home page consitently everywhere. Need this on stock page, and watchlist, and market thing page
  nw
- ✔️ The data on the compare stocks grid is not properly aligned in a grid. it's not showing up in the proper line, and grid lines are not visible

- ✔️ in watchlist we should show symbols cof each stock, also in compare grid on stock page and watchlist, we should show symbol on top of all. In order to show a better comparison maybe we can show some more icons and graphics as well too of the data.

- ✔️ in stock page compare, on each individual stock, we need to have the compare thing appear vertically, rather than horizontally right now, underneath the chart thing.

- on chart we need to see whether we can plot the news and stuff on the chart

- ✔️on home page in content topics we need to show less number of news, like top 5 topics that have most number of articles. check news apis and stuff we're calling in the other news things and stuff and see how we can show this. just want to reduce this

- ✔️in heading bar, along with my watchlist and market overview, we should have a button to go see news and navigate there

- ✔️in my watchlist instead of grid and list we need to have small cards that go in a row

- ✔️in the chart the "showing today" and the box underneath, we need to remove that
